Scooter
-------

Electric scooter networks did not yet arrive to Olivos.
They arrived in Buenos Aires in March this year (LaNacion_, 2019), but have not been seen yet in the streets.
Sidewalks end at every block and are mostly narrow and in many places broken. Not all corners count with curb ramps. So it's questionable, if scooters will be successful in Olivos, respectively in Buenos Aires in general.


Public transport
----------------

Olivos Roche counts with one railway line, a BRT line, express bus lines and several local bus lines:

Level of Service
================

Walking
-------

In general, walking is comfortable and feasable in Olivos Roche, due to the all over existing paved sidewalks.

The grid system makes it easy no navigate and calculate distances, but causes 30% longer walking distances than a grid system with diagonal streets.

Pedestrians always need to be attendant, where they put their feet, due to the changing sidewalk sizes, surface types, broken parts, wholes or animal dung.

Walking with heavy or huge bags or caddy may be complicated, due to missing curb ramps or broken sidewalks.

During the day people feel safe and walk much. In the night, dark sidewalks sections, caused by big trees, covering street lighting, not maintained or littered sidewalks, make people feel unsafe at some places. Also there is not much activity on most of the streets, as there are not so many shops and most of them are concentrated around Carlos Villate and Gobernador Manuel Ugarte.



Improvement recommendations
===========================

Low cost projects
-----------------

Projects with low cost but high impact, which could be implemented quickly.

* Traffic law enforcement (sidewalk maintenance and size, tree size and clearance, street parking, velocity, ...)
* Replacement of transit frequencies by schedules, publish transit schedules at stops and online
* Bicycle lanes, load and onload zones, ... (Paint only)
* Move (shelterless) bus stops for better multi-modal connections
* Prioritized traffic lights for transit
* Prioritize road maintenance for transit corridors

Medium cost projects
--------------------

* Enhance street lighting and lightened advertisements for more security
* More cafes and shops around the plazas
* Corner enhancements for transit turning corners
* Replace at-grade rain water sewer at crossings by underground sewer
* Street furniture
* On-street bicycle parking


High cost projects
------------------

Projects that require long term funds and planning and are costly to implement.

* Urban villages (local centers with shops, restaurants, corner stores, street cafes, parks, street furniture, etc) so people had more opportunities in walking distance.
* Monitored bicycle parkings at railway stations and important bus stops
* Replace traffic lights by bus-friendly roundabouts
* Transit centers Cetrangolo, Mitre and Panamericana
* Rail extension
* Separated Bicycle lanes
* Local road corner enhancements
