Walking
-------

The streets and collectors are following a grid system.
All blocks count with paved sidewalks. As their maintenance is responsibility of the property owners, they are of different sizes, surfaces and qualities. 
Pedestrian crossings on collectors mostely count with curb ramps, some corners of local streets also count with them.

          Sidewalk parking at España St. / Buenos Aires St.

Pedestrians always need to be attendant, where they put their feet, due to the changing sidewalk sizes, surface types, broken parts, wholes or animal dung.

All streets have street lighting and tree rows. In general, the streets are well lighted. But at some places, the tree rows make the sidewalk quite dark, as they cover the street lamps.

There is not much activity on most of the streets at early and late hours, as there are not so many shops and most of them are concentrated around Carlos Villate and Gobernador Manuel Ugarte.


Cycling
-------

Olivos Roche does not yet count with public bicycle infrastructure like bicycle lanes or paths. Cyclists share the streets with cars. The collectors count with a lot of traffic around peek hours and are not comfortable to ride. 


.. list-table::
   :class: table-borderless

          :width: 100%

          Speed humps at Olaguer y Feliú St. / Juan B. Justo St.

Some collectors do not have sufficient wide lanes (e.g. 1 lane + 0.75 lane + 0.75 parking lane). This makes it dangerous to drive between the driving cars and parked cars.

Local streets on the other side, count with speed bumps every two blocks, are crossed by at-grade sewer and are interrupted at some places by the railway line or the Panamericana highway.
In the last years installed speed humps are quite dangerous for bicycles, as they need to be crossed diagonal.

   A typical local street in Olivos Roche (Rastreador Fournier St. / Ignacio Warnes St.)

In the morning or evening, bicycling may also be a security problem, as it happens from time to time, that bicyclists are assaulted on low activity streets.

There are no bicycle parking or monitored bicycle stations. Parking bicycles on the street for a longer time is not feasable, as they got stolen.

Bicycles can be taken on the train. The first and last coach contain bicycle racks to store them safely.
On the bus it's not allowed to carry the bicycle.



Scooters
--------

Electric scooter networks did not yet arrive to Olivos.
They arrived in Buenos Aires in March this year (LN2019_, 2019), but have not been seen yet in the streets.
Sidewalks end at every block and are mostly narrow and in many places broken. Not all corners count with curb ramps. So it's questionable, if scooters will be successful in Olivos, respectively in Buenos Aires in general.


Transit
-------

Olivos Roche counts with one railway line, a BRT line, express bus lines and several local bus lines:

.. figure:: images/maps/map-transit-lines.jpg
   :width: 100%

   Metrobus Norte (BRT line north), Mitre commuter rail and Panamericana express buses (OSM2019_, 2019, `-34.5159,-58.5107 <https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/-34.5159/-58.5107&layers=T>`_)


Local transit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bus
...

The common bus lines are mostly driving on the collectors, some also pass through local streets.
Stops are marked with a sign at a close tree or light pole. Some stops have garbage bins or shelters.

Almost no stop has lighting or lighted advertisement panels. But some stops are well lighted by street lamps.
Also the stops do not count with any information about the route or the service frequencies.

Buses often stop far away from the curb, entering with caddy or huge bags is complicated, even for low floor buses.

Regional transit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mitre Railway
.............

The Mitre commuter railway connects the station Bartolomé Mitre with the main station Retiro in the city center. Close to Olivos Roche it also stops at the station Dr. Cetrangolo.
At the terminal station Bartolomé Mitre, a pedestrian bridge connects to the Terminal station of the Tren de la costa on the other side of the road, which takes passengers to Tigre in the north of Greater Buenos Aires.

BRT
...

On Maipu Avenue, there is a Metrobus line (BRT lime), beginning at the corner Malaver/Maipu, heading to the city center of Buenos Aires). Several bus lines serve them (152, 19, 203, 21, 59, 168, 71).

Frequencies
~~~~~~~~~~~

All buslines (common & express) have frequencies between 12 and one services per hour. Frequently, buses get delayed by rail barriers, congestion or amiss parked cars. So it may happen, that people need to wait 20 minutes and then two buses arrive in tandem.

Fares
~~~~~

In general, transit is cheap in Buenos Aires, compared to other services. Prices raise stagged by the distance, but the first stage is quite long. Currently (26/05/19) the prices for the first stage are as follows:

.. list-table::   
   :header-rows: 1

   * -
     - Price (ARS)
     - Price (USD by 26/05/19)
   * - Mitre railway
     - $18
     - U$S 0.40
   * - Bus
     - $12.25
     - U$S 0.25
   * - Express bus (+25%)
     - $22.5
     - U$S 0.50
   * - Express bus on highway (+75%)
     - $31.5
     - U$S 0.70
     
The median income in Argentina was ARS $16'293 per month (~USD $468.-) for the first term 2018 (PN2018_, 2018), what is about 10% of the median income for the United States and 9% for Switzerland (GPD2018_, 2018) at the same time. Compared to Switzerland, the fares in Buenos Aires are still more then 50% cheaper, in relation to the median  salary.



Taxi, Radio Taxi, Uber and Cabify
---------------------------------

There are several taxi companies in Olivos Roche. In front of the terminal station Mitre there is a public taxi stand, but Dr. Cetrangolo station is too small, to count with a taxi stand.

     - * More expensive than Uber

Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) like Uber and Cabify are highly available and used. Cabify counts with professional drivers and has agreements with companies for corporal rides of employees.

Late in the evening, when transit frequencies drop, people tend to return by taxi or Uber and in the night, they are the only available travel mode.

There are districts in Buenos Aires, which are not served by Taxis or TNCs, for example the Slums.

   * - * Extensive sidewalk network
       * Grid system, short access
       * Curb ramps on collectors
       * Well lighting
       * Green spaces (trees and grassed areas)
     - * Broken/littered/dark sidewalk section
       * Missing curb ramps on local streets
       * Few activity on the streets in the evening
       * No benches/street furniture to rest and stay

Walking is well accessible and safe in Olivos Roche, due to the all over existing paved sidewalks.
The grid system makes it easy to navigate and calculate distances.

Walking with heavy or huge bags, buggy or caddy may be complicated, due to missing curb ramps or broken sidewalks.

During the day people feel safe and walk much. In the night, dark sidewalks sections and not maintained or littered sidewalks, make people feel unsafe at some places. Missing activites on many roads contribute to that sense.

   :width: 60%

   Hierarchy of Walking needs within a Social-Ecological Framework (AM2005_, 2005, p. 820)

Looking Alfonzos Walking needs classification (Alfozo, 2005), we can say, the basic needs accessibility and safety are satisfied at a high level in Olivos Roche, but there is room for improvement for comfortable and pleasurable walking. 


Cycling
-------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - .. image:: images/icon-smile-face.png
          :width: 0.75cm
          :target: RI2019_

   * - * Local streets allow safe cycling
       * Bicycle racks at shops
       * Bicycle racks on the train
     - * Dangerous speed humps & at-grade sewer
       * Cycling on collectors and in the night is dangerous
       * No bicycle lanes/paths, parking spaces or monitored bicycle stations

The bicycle infrastructure in Olivos, Roche does clearly not satisfy the cyclists needs. The only existing bicycle infrastructure are the bicycle racks on the train.

The local streets allow safe cycling, but count with a lot of speed bumps and at-grade sewers.


Scooters
--------

As scooters did not yet arrive to Olivos, there aren't yet experiences with them.
It can be assumed, most critiques for walking and cycling also apply for scooters.


Transit
-------

       * Extensive local bus network
       * High frequencies during the day
       * Railway & BRT accessibility (at-grade)
       * Cheap fares
     - * Buses and BRT lines have frequencies, no fixed schedules
       * Local bus stops are not well maintained
       * Only a few bus stops count with shelter or lighting
       * Crowded in rush hours
       * Frequencies drop in the evening

The transit offer is good in Olivos Roche, services are available up to late hours in the evening. But in rush hours, trains and buses are crowded.

The unreliable frequencies make it complicated to plan a multi modal trip and people need to plan with sufficient margen, what makes it unattractive, in comparison to car or TNC trips.

As the fares are cheap, for many poor people it's the only way to travel, as they can not afford any motorized vehicle.


Taxi, Radio Taxi, Uber and Cabify

     - * Trust in drivers is not always given
       * Do not drive to all places (e.g. Slums)

Taxi and TNC services are highly available service in Olivos Roche, but the drivers do not always give the best impressions and its much more expensive than transit.

Improvement recommendations
===========================

Low cost projects
-----------------

Projects with low cost but high impact, which could be implemented quickly.

* Traffic law enforcement
* Transit schedules
* Spaces for disadvantaged modes (lane marking only)
* Bus stop consolidation
* Prioritized traffic lights
* Road maintenance prioritization for transit corridors
* More commercial activity


Traffic law enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A significant enhancement of the sidewalk quality, walkability and traffic secutiry could be reached, enforcing already existing laws:

* Forcing property owners to fix their sidewalks, to match standards and laws and maintain them appropiately (sidewalks are at the property owners responsibility).
* Forcing the municipality to cut the trees regularly, to maintain a minimal clearance, to prevent trees from covering street lamps (Tree cutting is at the municipalities responsibility, even when the trees are planted by the property owner).
* Stopping people from parking on the sidewalk, in driveways and in the second line, to allow pedestrians and bicycles to circulate without obstacles.
* Applying traffic laws regarding speed, traffic lights and parking to increase traffic safety.


Transit schedules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A replacement of frequencies by fixed schedules for transit and implementing buffer times and early-turning-points for delayed services, could allow transit users to plan their trips and connections.

Published schedules at the stops, in the vehicles itself and online, could give users easy access to them. Publiching them in common open-data formats under an open-data license could support plattforms and app-developers to integrate this information in their services.


Spaces for disadvantaged modes (lane marking only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating bicycle lanes, bicycle boxes, load and onload zones, bus lanes and stopping areas, using lane marking, could create reserved spaces for all modes, without big investments.
Once the new measures proved themselves and the street needs to be maintained anyway, the lane marking could be replaced by traffic islands or new curbs.


Bus stop consolidation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Olivos Roche has around 25 local bus stops. Most of them are located only 200m away from the next stop, but there are blocks, where stops are located every 100m.
The density of the bus lines allows to put stops every 300m, without causing riders to walk much more. That way, the amount of stops could be reduced by around 30%, what had a positive impact on the average speed of the buses, but also increased the investment per stop, to maintain them better.
As only a few stops have shelters, moving them is a small investment.


Road maintenance prioritization for transit corridors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prioritizing road maintenance for roads with transit lines, could make rides more comfortable and reduce the maintenance cost on the vehicles, caused by bumpy roads and loose pavement parts.


Prioritized traffic lights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replacing traffic lights, which need to be replaced anyway, by new traffic lights with priority signal support, allowed to recognize buses and create green waves for them. This leaded to more schedule stability and higher average speed.


More commercial activity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adjust regulations to ease the opening of cafes or small shops around transit stops, could increase the activities around these places, and make them safer. It also may help to reduce the amount of trips people do, as they can by stuff for their basic needs on their way home.



Medium cost projects
--------------------

* Better transit stop lighting
* Corner enhancements for transit
* Street furniture
* On-street bicycle parking
* Bus bicycle racks


Better transit stop lighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An enhancement of the lighting at transit stop by installing proper lighting, additional street lamps or lighted advertisement panels, could increase the safety of bus stops and provide revenue from the advertisement panels. There exist already solar panel/battery sets which allow to power the installations with connecting them to an electric network.


Corner enhancements for transit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adjusting corners, where buses are turning, could increase the turning speed and reduce the amount of time, buses were stuck at corners. To achieve that, a bigger curb radius is needed and barrier areas, to prevent people parking close to the corner.

This could also enhance the crossing safety for other modes like bicycles or pedestrians.

On-street bicycle parking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Other places in Olivos already count with explicit motorcycle and bicycle parking in commercial areas. Most of them are former street-parking-places, converted into cycle parking spaces and equipt with the necessary stands.

          Corners with commercial activities, where bicycle parking spaces made sense (OSM2019_, 2019, `-34.5228/-58.5008 <https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/-34.5228/-58.5008&layers=C>`_)

The same concept could make it more attractive, to go shopping by bicycle in Olivos Roche.


Bus bicycle racks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transport the bicycle on the bus, could allow people, to use their bicycle more extensive, as they could take the bus, when they feel unsafe in the evening, or are too tired to return cycling.
In other countries, there are different systems used successfully: Front racks, rear racks or rack inside the bus, near the entrance.

High cost projects
------------------

Projects that require long term funds and planning and are costly to implement, but which also would have a significant impact.

* Transit centers
* Rail extension
* Separated Bicycle lanes
* Local street green corners


Transit centers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating transit centers with shops, services and monitored bicycle parking spaces could provide people everything for their daily needs and make that places more attractive and safer.

Monitored bicycle would allow people to take the bicycle to transit, and park it safe.

   Recommended places for transit centers with monitored bicycle parking spaces: Dr. Cetrangolo train station, the Panamericana bus and express bus stops Gobernador Manuel Ugarte and Antonio Malaver and Carlos Villate St. / España St. (bus hotspot) (OSM2019_, 2019, `-34.5228, -58.5008 <https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/-34.5228/-58.5008&layers=C>`_)


Separated Bicycle lanes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Physically separated bicycle lanes or bidirectional bicycle highways could provide a high quality infrastructure to cyclists and make cycling much more attractive.

The collectors in Olivos Roche count currently with 1.75 driving and 0.75 parking lane. Often, it's not possible that two cars drive beside each others, so the real capacity of the road is around one lane.
This configuration could be changed to one driving lane, a parking/bus-stop/load-zone lane and a bicycle highway, without loosing much capacity. Parking should be payed, not free.

Local street green corners
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Local streets are mostely wide, count with speed bumps every blocks and street parking.
There is a lot of space at the corners, which could be used to make green corners and place street furniture, to make them more attractive for walkers and increase activity.

Rail extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The panamericana highway counts with high bus frequencies and rider volumes. A railway (heavy rail extension or new light rail line) could provide a high quality transit option for all the districts along the highway.

The idea, to create a railway along the Panamericana highway, is not new. The railway fanpage Cronica Ferroviaria (CF2017_, 2017) published such a concept two years ago:
