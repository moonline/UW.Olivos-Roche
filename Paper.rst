Walking
-------

The streets and avenues are following a grid system. Most blocks are around 100m long.
All blocks count with paved sidewalks. A part of the street corners also have curb ramps. As the sidewalk is responsibility of the property owners, the are of different size, surface and quality. Pedestrian crossings on avenues mostely count with curb ramps.

          Sidewalk parking at España St. / Buenos Aires St.

Pedestrians always need to be attendant, where they put their feet, due to the changing sidewalk sizes, surface types, broken parts, wholes or animal dung.

All streets have street lighting and tree rows. In general, the streets are well lighted. But at some places, the tree rows make the sidewalk quite dark, as the cover the street lamps.

There is not much activity on most of the streets, especially at early and late hours, as there are not so many shops and most of them are concentrated around Carlos Villate and Gobernador Manuel Ugarte.


Cycling
-------

Olivos Roche does not yet count with public bicycle infrastructure.
There are no bicycle lanes or paths, cyclists use the streets shared with cars. The avenues count with heavy traffic and are not comfortable to ride. 


.. list-table::
   :class: table-borderless

          :width: 100%

          Speed humps at Olaguer y Feliú St. / Juan B. Justo St.

Some avenues do not have sufficient wide lanes (e.g. 1 lane + 0.75 lane + 0.75 parking lane). This makes it dangerous to drive between the driving cars and parked cars.
As some avenues are congested in peek hours, its even more difficult to drive a bicycle on them.

Local streets on the other side, count with speed bumps every blocks and are interrupted at some places by the railway lanes.
In the last years installed speed humps are quite dangerous for bicycles, as they need to be crossed diagonal.

In the morning or evening, bicycling may also be a security problem, as it happens from time to time, that bicyclists are assaulted.

There are no bicycle parking or monitored bicycle stations. Parking bicycles on the street for a longer time is not feasable, as they got stolen.

Bicycles can be taken on the train. The first and last coach contain bicycle racks to store them safely.
On the bus it's not allowed to carry the bicycle.



Scooters
--------

Electric scooter networks did not yet arrive to Olivos.
They arrived in Buenos Aires in March this year (LaNacion_, 2019), but have not been seen yet in the streets.
Sidewalks end at every block and are mostly narrow and in many places broken. Not all corners count with curb ramps. So it's questionable, if scooters will be successful in Olivos, respectively in Buenos Aires in general.


Public transport
----------------

Olivos Roche counts with one railway line, a BRT line, express bus lines and several local bus lines:

.. figure:: maps/map-transit-lines.jpg
   :width: 100%

   Metrobus Norte (BRT line north), Mitre commuter rail and Panamericana express buses (OpenStreetMap_, 2019, `-34.5159/-58.5107 <https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/-34.5159/-58.5107&layers=T>`_)


Local transit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bus
...

The common bus lines are mostly driving on the big and small avenues, some also pass through local streets.
Most of the stops do not have a shelter or a an extra stop sign. Often there is only a small sign at a near tree or light pole.
Some stops count with garbage bins. Almost no stop has lighting and lighted advertising panels did not arrive yet to Olivos. 
Also the stops also do not count with any information about the route or the service frequencies.s

Taxi, Radio Taxi, Uber and Cabify
---------------------------------

There are several taxi companies in Olivos Roche. In front of the terminal station Mitre there is a public taxi stop. Dr. Cetrangolo station is too small, to count with a taxi stand.

          :width: 0.75cm
          :target: Roundicons_
   * - * Extensive sidewalk network
       * Grid system, short access
       * Curb ramps on avenues
       * Well lighting
     - * Broken sidewalks
       * Littered sidewalks
       * Missing curb ramps on local streets
       * Dark sidewalk sections
       * Few activity on the streets in the evening

In general, walking is well accessible and safe in Olivos Roche, due to the all over existing paved sidewalks.

The grid system makes it easy no navigate and calculate distances, but causes 30% longer walking distances than a grid system with diagonal streets.

Walking with heavy or huge bags or caddy may be complicated, due to missing curb ramps or broken sidewalks.

During the day people feel safe and walk much. In the night, dark sidewalks sections, caused by big trees, and not maintained or littered sidewalks, make people feel unsafe at some places. Missing activites on many roads contribute to that sense.

.. figure:: images/Alfonzo-2005-Hierarchy-of-walking-needs.jpg
   :width: 75%

   Hierarchy of Walking needs within a Social-Ecological Framework (Alfonzo_, 2005, p. 820)

Looking Alfonzos Walking needs classification (Alfozo, 2005), we can say, the basic needs Accessibility and Safety are satisfied at a high level in Olivos Roche, but there is room for improvement for comfortable and pleasurable Walking. 


Cycling
-------

.. list-table::

          :width: 0.75cm
          :target: Roundicons_
   * - * Local streets allow secure cycling
       * Bicycle rack on the train
     - * Dangerous speed humps
       * Cycling on avenues and in the night is dangerous
       * No bicycle lanes/paths or parkings
       * No monitored bicycle stations

The bicycle infrastructure in Olivos, Roche does clearly not satisfy the cyclists needs. They are more or less ignored by the municipality, the focus lays completely on car traffic and walking. The only existing bicycle infrastructure are the bicycle racks on the train.


Scooters
--------

As scooters did not yet arrive to Olivos, there is not yet any thought about their integration into the public space and traffic flows.
Most critiques for walking and cycling also apply for scooters. There is not infrastructure, where you can ride it and you can't ride it on the sidewalks.

Improvement recommendations
===========================

Low cost projects
-----------------

Projects with low cost but high impact, which could be implemented quickly.

* Traffic law enforcement
* Transit schedules
* Spaces for disadvantaged modes (lane marking only)
* Bus stop consolidation
* Prioritized traffic lights
* Prioritize road maintenance for transit corridors


Traffic law enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A significant enhancement of the sidewalk quality, walkability and traffic secutiry could be reached, enforcing already existing laws:

* Force property owners to fix their sidewalks, to match standards and laws and maintain them appropiately (sidewalks are at the property owners responsibility).
* Force the municipality to cut the trees to maintain a minimal clearance to prevent trees from covering street lamps (Tree cutting is at the municipalities responsibility, even when the trees are planted by the property owner).
* Stop people from parking on the sidewalk, in driveways and in the second line, to allow pedestrians and bicycles to circulate without obstacles.
* Enforce traffic laws regarding speed, traffic lights parking to increase traffic safety.


Transit schedules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replace transit frequencies by fixed schedules, implement buffer times and early-turning-points for delayed services, to allow transit users to plan their trips and connections.

Publish schedules at the stops, in the vehicles itself and online, to give users easy access to them. Also publish them in common open-data formats under an open-data license, to allow plattforms and app-developers to integrate this services.


Spaces for disadvantaged modes (lane marking only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create bicycle lanes, bicycle boxes, load and onload zones, bus lanes and stopping areas using lane marking.
This allows to create reserved spaces for all modes, without big investments.
Once the new measures proved themselves and the street needs to be maintained anyway, the lane marking can be replaced by traffic islands or new curbs.


Bus stop consolidation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Olivos Roche has around 25 local bus stops. Most of them have are 200m away from the next stop, but there are blocks, where stops are located every 100m.
The density of the bus lines allows to put stops every 300m, without causing riders to walk much more. That way, the amount of stops could be reduced by around 30%, what had a positive impact on the average speed of the buses, but also allows to invest more per stop, and maintain them better.
As only a few stops have shelters, moving them is a small investment.


Prioritize road maintenance for transit corridors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prioritize road maintenance for roads with public transport lines, to make rides more comfortable and reduce the maintenance cost on the vehicles, caused by bumpy roads and loose pavement parts.


Prioritized traffic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replace traffic lights, which need to be replaced anyway, by new traffic lights with priority signal support, to recognize buses and create green waves for them. This allows more schedule stability and higher average speed.



Medium cost projects
--------------------

* Enhance street lighting and lightened advertisements for more security
* More cafes and shops around the plazas
* Corner enhancements for transit turning corners
* Replace at-grade rain water sewer at crossings by underground sewer
* Street furniture
* On-street bicycle parking
* Bus bicycle racks


High cost projects
------------------

Projects that require long term funds and planning and are costly to implement.

* Urban villages (local centers with shops, restaurants, corner stores, street cafes, parks, street furniture, etc) so people had more opportunities in walking distance.
* Monitored bicycle parkings at railway stations and important bus stops
* Replace traffic lights by bus-friendly roundabouts
* Transit centers Cetrangolo, Mitre and Panamericana
* Rail extension
* Separated Bicycle lanes / bidirectional bicycle highways
* Local road corner enhancements
